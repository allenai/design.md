  # ── Semantic UI Tokens ────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Use these first. Semantic tokens carry intent and adapt if the
  # design system is updated. Three-layer architecture: Primitives →
  # Tokens → Platform. Tokens below list both Light and Dark values —
  # dark mode inverts (not just darkens): backgrounds swap from warm
  # whites/off-whites to deep teal, text flips accordingly, and status
  # tokens shift to lighter/more-saturated primitive steps for contrast.

  # Background
  # Dark-mode surfaces form one continuous teal ladder — Primary (darkest)
  # → Elevated → Secondary (lightest) — rather than mixing in grey.

## Overview

EarthRanger is a platform for conservationists to collect data from the field, integrate cutting-edge technology, see wildlife and teams in real time, and develop strategies that accelerate conservation impact. The platform encompasses EarthRanger Web, EarthRanger Mobile, Ecoscope, Gundi, and the Buoy app — a suite of tools built around data-driven decision making and adaptive management.

EarthRanger is used by a broad range of conservation professionals: protected area managers, field personnel, analysts, operations coordinators, and technologists. Interfaces must serve both experts in the field making time-sensitive decisions and analysts working through complex data sets at a desk.

The design language prioritizes **usability and data security above all else**. EarthRanger is trustworthy, innovative, and approachable. Every interface decision should reinforce that the platform is reliable and built for serious work — without being intimidating or opaque.

EarthRanger's visual identity is grounded in Ai2's brand standards, using the same three-layer token architecture as Strata (Primitives → Tokens → Platform). The primary CTA color is green; teal is the brand/secondary accent and appears in navigation, headers, and brand moments. Pink is never used in EarthRanger interfaces. Dark mode is a first-class, fully-defined mode (not just light-mode tokens dimmed) — it inverts rather than darkens: backgrounds swap from white/off-white to deep teal, text flips accordingly, and status colors shift to lighter/more-saturated steps for contrast on the dark surface. Data colors (categorical, tracks, sequential) are mode-stable — the same primitives work on both light and dark backgrounds.

## Colors

Always use **semantic tokens** (e.g. `UI/Text/Primary Text`) instead of raw primitive values wherever possible. Semantic tokens carry intent, provide both a Light and Dark value, and will automatically adapt if the design system is updated.

The primary interactive color is `UI/CTA Primary` (`#0f865d` light / `#0fcb8c` dark, Green/12 and Green/7) — used for calls to action, links, and active states. Status colors are strictly functional: use them only to communicate system state (error, success, warning, running), never decoratively. Blue is reserved for the `Running` status only — it is not a general-purpose interactive color.

Teal (`Teal/T100`, `#105257` light / `#faf2e9` off-white text on `Teal/T100` dark surfaces) is the primary brand accent and appears in navigation, headers, form labels/tabs, and `UI/CTA Secondary Blue`. `Brand/Accent Green` (`#0f865d` light / `#0fcb8c` dark) shares its values with `UI/CTA Primary` — they're the same brand-accent green.

Use `UI/Text/Primary Text Reversed` (`#ffffff` light / `#0a3235` dark — the inverse of `UI/Text/Primary Text`) for text or icon marks that sit directly on a brand-teal surface, such as a filled default-intent button or a checked control's mark. Teal is a mid-tone in light mode but becomes a pale tint in dark mode, so a fixed light color reads fine in light mode but disappears in dark mode — this token flips with the mode so it always contrasts against the surface it's on.

Pink is not part of the EarthRanger palette. Do not introduce any pink values, even from the broader Ai2 primitive palette.

For data visualization, use the categorical, tracks, and sequential scales in order — do not skip steps or substitute brand colors. These scales are designed for perceptual distinctiveness and accessibility across the full range of values, and are intentionally identical in Light and Dark mode.

## Typography

EarthRanger shares Strata's unified text-style scale — Display, Heading (XL/LG/MD/SM), Body (LG/MD/SM/XS), and Mono — rather than maintaining separate per-platform scales. What changes per platform is only the **font-family**, via the `platform.body` and `platform.heading` tokens:

| Platform | Body | Heading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web Fonts | Roboto | PP Telegraf |
| Windows | Arial | Arial |
| iOS | SF Pro | SF Pro |
| Android | Roboto | Roboto |

Always reference a text-style token (e.g. `body-md`, `heading-lg`) rather than hardcoding font properties directly — the platform's font-family resolves automatically. `body-md` (16px / 25.6px line height) is the default reading size. All styles use 0 letter-spacing and no text-transform.

### Fallback stack (performance)

EarthRanger is used in low-bandwidth field conditions where a delayed web font can mean delayed information in high-stakes moments (active patrols, incident response). Always pair the web font with a fast, native fallback — never a generic one. See Do's and Don'ts below for the full performance checklist.

### External communications (Manrope) — not for UI

Manrope is a typographic option for **externally-facing communications only**: slide decks, EarthRanger.com, email newsletters, and printed materials. It is **never** used in product UI — product interfaces always use Roboto for body text via the `platform.body` tokens above.

Scope is deliberately narrow: Manrope replaces Roboto for **body text only** (`external-comms-body-lg/md/sm/xs`, same sizes/line-heights as the UI Body scale). Headings in external communications still use PP Telegraf, exactly as in product UI — do not substitute Manrope for headings anywhere.

## Icons

> **Never substitute a different icon for the one shown in the design.** Always match exactly what is specified.

### Library 1: Material Design Icons

- **Source:** Material Design Icons Figma library (`x3D0XAL06JEEEi12suKcGs`)
- **Style:** Outlined (default); filled variants exist for some icons
- **Default size:** 24×24px
- **Usage:** Primary icon library — search for any standard UI icon here first
- **Color:** Use `UI/Icons` token (`#767676`) by default unless the design specifies otherwise

### Library 2: ER Design System Custom Icons

- **Source:** ER Design System Figma file (`gQJAI5XKeENQsqkCaFBev3`), Icons page
- **Style:** Custom filled icons specific to the EarthRanger domain
- **Default size:** 18×18px for most icons; 16×16px for menu bar and inline UI icons
- **Usage:** Use these for domain-specific concepts not covered by Material (e.g. Patrol, Spoor, Basemap, Fence, Wildlife Sighting, GPS, Report, Observation Patrol, Deforestation, etc.)
- **Variants:** Some icons have filled/outline or state variants (e.g. Cloud Online/Offline, Eye Open/Closed, Active/Inactive, Download states) — use the variant that matches the design exactly
- **Note:** The ER icon library references Material Design as its base — for any icon not listed as a custom symbol, search the Material Design library

## Do's and Don'ts

**Don't place `UI/Text/Primary Text` (or the raw dark-teal/`extra-dark-teal` primitives) on a solid `UI/CTA Primary` or `Brand/Accent Green` fill (Green/12 in light mode).** It measures ~3:1 contrast — under the 4.5:1 WCAG AA minimum for normal text, only clearing the 3:1 floor for large text/UI outlines. Use `UI/Text/Primary Text Reversed` instead, which resolves to white in light mode. In dark mode this isn't an issue — Green/7 is bright enough that dark text reads fine there.

**Don't use emojis in EarthRanger interfaces — use an icon library instead.** See the Icons section above: Material Design Icons for standard UI icons, ER Design System Custom Icons for domain-specific concepts (Patrol, Spoor, Basemap, Fence, Wildlife Sighting, etc.). Emojis render inconsistently across platforms/fonts and don't carry the states (filled/outline, active/inactive, etc.) the icon libraries provide.

**Don't load web fonts without these performance safeguards.** EarthRanger is used in low-bandwidth field conditions where a delayed font can mean delayed information in high-stakes moments (active patrols, incident response).

- **Native OS fallback** if the web font hasn't loaded — Windows: Arial, Android: Roboto, iOS: SF Pro
- **Subset fonts** to strip unneeded characters, using `glyphhanger` or `fonttools`
- **Regular and Bold weights only** — don't ship the full weight range
- **`font-display: optional`** so a slow-loading web font never blocks rendering or shifts layout
- **Self-host fonts** — don't depend on a third-party CDN round trip
